Write a reaction log (150 or more words). This log should be completed after reading/viewing all this weekâ€™s materials:
a. Textbook Preface.
It's been a few years since i've loooked at this text, but recall it's a good one.  
I'm excitited to start using it via github and putting that tool to use - something i've been meaning to learn how to use for years now, but never gotten around to it.  As there really wasnt a strong reason as to devoting the time to learning how to use it...
The section that jumps out as potentially most interesting at this point is the Javadoc Appendix - perhaps i'll spend some time there and brush up on some of those documentation standards.  This could well prove to be a good section to reference for the students - they always struggle to understand and implement proper documentation.  I've used basic templates in the past - like a standard framework they have to copy, but to give them a reading could be good also.

b. Textbook Chapter 1.
c. Textbook Chapter 2.
d. Textbook Chapter 3.
e. Coding Mentors video (item #5).
f. Zamansky video (item #6b).

2. Answer the following:
a. What are the top things you learned from these out-of-class readings, videos, and exercises?
b. What information surprised you? What might you share with others or your current/future students?
c. What might you consider implementing in your own classroom?
d. What do you need to explore more? What the knowledge and skills that you may need to return to in the future to strengthen?
e. While it is good to reference specific materials in your discussion, please do not summarize the materials.
